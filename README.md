# Blockchain Campaign Project

## Overview

The Blockchain Campaign Project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain that allows users to contribute funds to campaigns, view their transactions, and ensures immutability through proof of work. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Blockchain Campaign Project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser with Metamask extension installed.
- Basic understanding of blockchain and smart contracts.

## Installation

To install the project and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlockchainCampaign.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd BlockchainCampaign
```

3. Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Run the development blockchain:

```bash
npm run ganache
```

2. Compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npm run compile
```

3. Deploy the smart contracts to the development blockchain:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

4. Start the web application:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Blockchain Campaign DApp.

## Features

The Blockchain Campaign DApp offers the following features:

1. **Campaign Creation**: Users can create new campaigns by providing campaign details and the funding goal.

2. **Contribute to Campaign**: Users can contribute funds to the campaigns they are interested in, using their connected Ethereum wallet (Metamask).

3. **Transaction History**: Users can view their transaction history, which includes details of the contributions made to various campaigns.

4. **Proof of Work**: The project uses a blockchain-based consensus mechanism (proof of work) to ensure immutability and security of the transactions.

## Technologies Used

The Blockchain Campaign Project is built using the following technologies:

- Solidity: Smart contract development language.
- Ethereum: The platform for deploying and executing smart contracts.
- Truffle: Development framework for Ethereum.
- Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- HTML/CSS: Front-end development technologies.
